# Three.js Quick Setup

A `three.js` example created without running a local server.

## About the Project

Due to browsers’ CORS policy, use this quick setup to develop your `three.js` application only if:

1. No contents load from external file. (eg. textures, models…)
2. Simple code: Cannot split Javascript from `.html` into `.js` and load it from local file system because `three.js` depend on ES module.

## Getting Started

Simply open `.html` file on browser from local file system.
